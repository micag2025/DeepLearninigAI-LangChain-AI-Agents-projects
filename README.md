Welcome to the AI-Agents repository! This repository contains  a collection of personalized  and reviewed code examples derived by three short courses offered on the [DeepLearning.AI platform](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) in collaboration with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/):

### AI Agents in LangGraph ü§ù  
Build agentic AI workflows using LangChain's LangGraph and Tavily's agentic search.

### Functions, Tools, and Agents with Langchain ‚úÖ 
Learn about the latest advancements in LLM APIs and use LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) to compose and customize chains and agents.

### LangChain for LLM Application Development üöÄ  
Use the powerful and extensible LangChain framework, using prompts, parsing, memory, chains, question answering and agents.



## ‚ùì What's Inside
  - Customized Code Examples: Original examples from the courses have been reviewed, refined, and personalized for improved clarity and usability.
  - Apply your skills creating an agent with Python and an LLM, using LangGraph to enhance it, and implementing agentic search, persistence, and human-in-the-loop systems. 
    You will have also the opportunity to see how to develop agents for tasks like essay writing, conversational agents, etc.
  - Ready-to-Run Notebooks: Test and modify pre-configured Jupyter notebooks.
  - Additional Resources: Links to documentation, model hubs, and supplementary learning materials.
  - See also the [apps Gradio](https://huggingface.co/collections/dlaima/ai-agents-in-langgraph-67a5cdb162e3f560e9d33b65) that you cab build up using Langchain.
