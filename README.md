Welcome to the AI-Agents repository! This repository contains  a collection of personalized  and reviewed code examples derived by the short course offered on the [DeepLearning.AI platform](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) in collaboration with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/):

## AI Agents in LangGraph 🤝

   - Build an Agent from Scratch 🤖
   - LangGraph Components 📚
   - Agentic Search Tools  🔍
   - Persistence and Streaming 🌐
   - Human in the Loop 👩‍💻
   - Essay Writer ✍️


## ❓ What's Inside
  - Customized Code Examples: Original examples from the courses have been reviewed, refined, and personalized for improved clarity and usability.
  - (Apply your skills to) Examples of real-world projects, using Python and AI, such as customizing recipes based on preferences and making data-driven decisions, or planning a dream vacation with detailed itineraries for multiple  
    destinations
  - Ready-to-Run Notebooks: Test and modify pre-configured Jupyter notebooks.
  - Additional Resources: Links to documentation, model hubs, and supplementary learning materials.
  - LangChain's LangGraph extension helps developers build controllable agents. This course covers creating an agent with Python and an LLM, using LangGraph to enhance it, and implementing agentic search, persistence, and human-in-the-loop systems. It also teaches how to develop agents for tasks like essay writing.
